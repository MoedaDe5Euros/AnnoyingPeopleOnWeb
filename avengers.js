          "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's
          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory
          has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers
          Assemble!"

          BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.
          Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

          EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE   NIGHT

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:
          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the
          CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem
          encircled with silver blades.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           But our ally knows its workings as they
           never will. He is ready to lead. And
           our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

          HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a
          seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply

          QUAKES.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The world will be his. The universe
           yours. And the humans, what can they do
           but burn?

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY   NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD   CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR   NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER   CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL   NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER   NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL   NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR   NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE   CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL   NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN   NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD   CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL   NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER   NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL   NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL   NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT   NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR   NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM   NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK   NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS   CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK   NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK   NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK   NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM   NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM   NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE   DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM   NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP   DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM   NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP   DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM   NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA   DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM   NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN   NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE   NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET   DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB   DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM   NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP   DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE   DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP   a flurry of
          activity   dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE   CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM   DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE   NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM   NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA   NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER   NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM   NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA   NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM   NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA   NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET   NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at th
