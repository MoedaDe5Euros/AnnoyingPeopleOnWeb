Part 1: "Don't Count On It, Batman"

Icelandic Local: [rough English] "Bruce... Wayne". "Bruce Wayne". [Icelandic] Storm's grounded choppers for six days. Where did he come from?

Arthur Curry: [Icelandic] He said he climbed over the mountain.

Icelandic Local: [Icelandic] Impossible.

Arthur Curry: Talk.

Bruce Wayne: I believe there is a stranger, comes to this village from the sea. He comes in the winter when the people are hungry. He brings fish. He comes on the king tide... That was last night.

Arthur Curry: You have eyes, so see -- Icebergs in the harbour. It's four months since the last ship got through.

Bruce Wayne: Well, this stranger... Doesn't come by ship.

[Arthur translates.]

Bruce Wayne: There are enemies coming, from far away. I need warriors. This stranger, others like him. I'm building an alliance, to defend ourselves. It's very important that I see this man.

Arthur Curry: If this stranger exists, I'll give him your message. Five thousand, American.

Bruce Wayne: Look, I'll give you twenty-five thousand to talk to this man right now, outside.

[The local laughs and the crowd follows with him.]

Icelandic Local: [English] How dare this dog speak to us like children! Ooh, magical man from the sea! We are poor. Not stupid. Get. Out!

Bruce Wayne: I'm sorry. I can't do that. I'll leave after we've spoken.

Arthur Curry: He said get out.

Bruce Wayne: [Icelandic] I don't think so.

Bruce Wayne: Arthur Curry. Also known as Protector of the Oceans. The Aquaman.

[Cut to Bruce and Arthur walking alongside each other outside.]

Arthur Curry: So let me get this straight... You do it dressed like a bat? Like an- Like an actual bat?

Bruce Wayne: It worked for 20 years in Gotham.

Arthur Curry: Oh, that shithole.

Bruce Wayne: When the fight comes, we'll need you.

Arthur Curry: Don't count on it, Batman.

Bruce Wayne: Why not?

Arthur Curry: Because I don't like you coming here, digging into my business, getting into my life. I wanna be left alone.

Bruce Wayne: That why you do this? Help these people out here in the middle of nowhere? I read the stories, your good deeds. You think no one sees? You'll join us.

Arthur Curry: Strong man is strongest alone. You ever heard that?

[Arthur takes off his shirt and casts it aside.]

Bruce Wayne: You ever hear of Superman? He died fighting next to me.

Arthur Curry: My point exactly.

[He wades into the waters.]

Bruce Wayne: Believe me, we're stronger together. We owe it to him.

Arthur Curry: I don't owe anyone anything. Dressed like a bat... You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne!

[The villagers begin to sing a song. Bruce turns to them and, when he goes back to the water, Arthur has disappeared. One of the women takes Arthur's coat and sniffs it, then resumes singing in tribute to Arthur. Cut to Martha Kent alone in a graveyard in the middle of the night. She walks away from Clark's grave and to her truck, which has a U-Haul trailer attached to it.]

Martha Kent: Move over, Dusty.

[She gets in the driver's seat and starts the car, driving past the Kent farm, which has a foreclosure sign in front of it.]

[Meanwhile, on a runway, a helicopter lands. Bruce steps out and approaches Alfred.]

Alfred Pennyworth: My god, Master Wayne, but this is cold! Maybe we could catch the next king tide in... Jamaica! Might be a metahuman or two in Fiji? Costa Rica's nice?

Bruce Wayne: I found him.

[Alfred spares Bruce a glance, then his face turns to shock.]

Bruce Wayne: He said "no".

Alfred Pennyworth: So, the draft stands at naught for two.

[Bruce shakes his head.]

Alfred Pennyworth: Maybe a man who broods in a cave for a living isn't cut out to be a recruiter.

[They walk onto Bruce's private jet.]

Barista: That's ten, please. Thank you.

Officer Jerry: Mornin', Miss Lane!

Lois Lane: Jerry, hey.

Officer Jerry: Wow! You don't miss a day, do you?

Lois Lane: Like it here.

Black Clad Member: Move it, move it! Move! Move!

Black Clad Alpha: Line them up along the wall! Keep them quiet!

Black Clad Alpha: We'll be making a statement shortly. Until then, if I see any movement, you'll have a lot of dead kids on your hands.

Task Force Sniper: Should I take him?

Task Force Leader: Hold your fire. They've got kids in there.

Task Force Deputy: Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief. Saint Bridget's had a school trip today.

Black Clad Heavy: Quiet! Shut up!

Black Clad Alpha: Down with the modern world. Back to the Dark Ages.

Black Clad Heavy: Quiet! I said shut your fuckin' mouth!

Wonder Woman: Who are you?! The Lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth. Now, who are you?

Black Clad Beta: We're a small group of reactionary terrorists who wanna turn back the clock in Europe a thousand years--

Wonder Woman: Boring. Why the hostages?

Black Clad Beta: We have no demands. We're just stalling the police while we do it.

Wonder Woman: While you do what?!

Black Clad Beta: You're too late. The countdown's already begun. In a few minutes, four city blocks... [He mimics an explosion.] While the world watches.

School Chaperone: No!

Black Clad Alpha: Like lambs to the slaughter...

Black Clad Alpha: I don't believe it!

Wonder Woman: Believe it.

Wonder Woman: Is everyone alright? You okay? Good. It's okay! It's okay, it's over! You can stand up. It's all good, it's over now. You okay? You okay? Good.

Wonder Woman: You okay, Princess?

Schoolgirl: Can I be like you someday?

Wonder Woman: You can be anything you want to be. Come on, let's go.

Queen Hippolyta: Any changes today?

Amazonian Guard 1: No, my Queen.

Amazonian Guard 2: The Motherbox has awoken, yet nothing has happened.

Queen Hippolyta: It has slept for thousands of years, since the First Age. Why did it wake at all?

Amazonian Guard 2: This is the first time it's gone quiet since the crack appeared.

Amazonian Guard 1: Maybe it's going back to sleep.

Queen Hippolyta: Evil does not sleep. It waits.

Amazonian Guard 2: Something is coming...

Queen Hippolyta: Prepare for battle!

Steppenwolf: Defenders. They have failed a hundred thousand worlds. They always fail. I have come to enlighten you to the Great Darkness! I will bathe in your fear!

Queen Hippolyta: Daughters of Themyscira... Show him your fear!

The Amazons: We have no fear!

Queen Hippolyta: Gather the Legions! Go with her!

Amazonian Guard 3: We must seal the cage!

Queen Hippolyta: No!

Amazonian Guard 3: To the masts!

Steppenwolf: No!

Queen Hippolyta: Epione!

Epione: Honor us. It's right. Seal it.

Queen Hippolyta: Ready the hammers!

Queen Hippolyta: Seal it now!

Queen Hippolyta: Guard it with your life.

Amazonian Horserider: Yes, my Queen. Keep it moving!

Amazonian Horserider 2: Got it! Go!

Steppenwolf: Oh, noble Queen... Why do you fight? You can't save her. You can't save any of them. The Great Darkness begins.

Amazonian Horserider 3: Amazons!

Steppenwolf: Yes, we will find the others.

Menalippe: He's gone back to his universe.

Queen Hippolyta: No. He's gone to the Lands of Men to find the other two boxes. We have to light the ancient warning fire.

Menalippe: The fire hasn't burned for five thousand years. Men won't know what it means.

Queen Hippolyta: Men won't. She will.
Part 2: The Age of Heroes

Steppenwolf: It's toxic. That's good.

Steppenwolf: Go! Follow the scent of the Motherboxes! Find the missing two! Once they are found, The Unity will be formed. This world will join the others. He will be pleased. He will see my worth again...

Bruce Wayne: Hey, uh... Anything on that kid from the liquor store?

Alfred Pennyworth: Possibly.

Bruce Wayne: "Possibly"... If I had a dollar for every "possibly"...

Alfred Pennyworth: Yeah, it'd make you even more insufferable. Facial scan might've got a hit on him -- our disappearing man. One Mr. Barry Allen from Central City. Might be another false positive, you'll have to give me a little time to confirm--

Bruce Wayne: We don't have any more time.

Alfred Pennyworth: Master Wayne, you've been working as if there's no tomorrow to build this team of people you can't even find.

Bruce Wayne: I found one. I found two, if you include Diana.

Alfred Pennyworth: Just because Lex Luthor says the planet's in danger of attack--

Bruce Wayne: This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor. It has to do with him. I made a promise to him, on his grave. I've spent a lot of time trying to divide us. I need to bring us together, and make this right.

Alfred Pennyworth: Well, it's been some time since Luthor's warning, and no attacks. No barbarians at the gate.

Bruce Wayne: Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate. Maybe they're already here. Keep looking, what else do you have?

Silas Stone: Lab's all yours, Howard.

Howard Jensen: 11:30? Early night for you, Silas.

Silas Stone: Yes. Early night. Tell your family I said hello?

Howard Jensen: What the...? Jesus!

Menalippe: The Arrow of Artemis. It will reach the Lands of Men.

Queen Hippolyta: Sky Torch, Hero Beacon, scatter the darkness. Burn, as you burned in days before. Show her the darkness before the daylight of history. Warn my daughter that war has come, and protect her.

Queen Hippolyta: Return to me, Diana...

Louvre Conversationalist: What did you do this weekend, Diana?

Diana Prince: Nothing very interesting.

Louvre Conversationalist: That's all you ever tell us.

Diana Prince: What can I do? I'm not that exciting.

Louvre Conversationalist: You might as well disappear when you walk out of here.

[An archaeologist enters, speaking French.]

Diana Prince: Again?

Louvre Conversationalist: What is it?

Diana Prince: Now what?

French Archaeologist: Budget cuts, tomb raiders, now add to the list: Arson.

Newscaster: Yes, good morning from the Isle of Crete. As you can see behind me, an enormous bonfire is burning. The fire has been burning through the night. We're now into the morning, and we are at least five miles away and we can still see it burning as we speak. This has baffled locals and government authorities alike here at this historical site of the so-called Shrine of the Amazons. Now, locals and government officials are baffled as to what may have caused this...

Diana Prince: Invasion...

Silas Stone: Ryan!

Ryan Choi: Hey, Doc.

Silas Stone: Is the...?

Ryan Choi: No damage to the Electron Laser.

CID Chief Detective: Uh, Doctor Silas Stone?

Silas Stone: Yeah.

CID Chief Detective: Ryan Choi?

Ryan Choi: That's us.

Silas Stone: Um... Who did this? Uh, did they steal anything?

CID Chief Detective: Uh, they took whatever was in here.

Ryan Choi: Oh, that? That wasn't stolen, was it, Doctor Stone?

Silas Stone: No, that was misplaced a while ago.

CID Chief Detective: "Object 61982, Department of Defense Archive".

Silas Stone: Mm-hm.

CID Chief Detective: What was it?

Silas Stone: I don't know.

CID Chief Detective: You don't know?

Silas Stone: I don't know, which is why I was studying it.

CID Chief Detective: What's your rank, Doctor?

Silas Stone: Ryan, would you, uh... do the honors?

Ryan Choi: Sure.

Silas Stone: Thanks. Civillian. S.T.A.R. Labs is a private contractor, we work for the DOD. We advise them on Xenosience.

CID Chief Detective: "Xenoscience"?

Silas Stone: Alien technology.

Silas Stone: For example: the Superman ship.

CID Chief Detective: Eight people never signed out of the lab last night, Doctor. Cleaning staff, guards, a few of your research scientists. They were abducted.

Silas Stone: Are you sure?

CID Chief Detective: Witness saw it all. He escaped. He's here in quarantine, working on an ID sketch.

CID Chief Detective: Any idea who or... what that might be?

Silas Stone: The box isn't safe here. Victor, they came looking for it at the lab. People were taken by some kind of... monster, or something.

Victor Stone: You know a lot about monsters, don't you?

Victor Stone: Especially how to make 'em.

Fisherman: Mayday! Mayday, mayday! My boat is beached! I'm going down!

Fisherman: Mayday! Is anybody out there?!

Arthur Curry: Whiskey.

Arthur Curry: Tell him to respect the storm next time?

Arthur Curry: It's on him.

Nudis Vulko: King who would be man! Son of a human father and queen of the seas. All the time I wasted, trying to keep the promise I made to your mother.

Arthur Curry: You finished, old man?

Nudis Vulko: You never sleep in the same place twice, yet you keep coming back here.

Arthur Curry: I like it. It's quiet.

Nudis Vulko: It's your inheritance. You're the rightful king of Atlantis. Our people suffer.

Arthur Curry: Your people. A brutal, petty, superstitious race.

Nudis Vulko: It's the surface any different?

Arthur Curry: Nobody calls me King of the Surface. What do you want, Vulko?

Nudis Vulko: Guards near the stronghold have been disappearing. Snatchers from above.

Arthur Curry: Talk to King Orm.

Nudis Vulko: Your brother...

Arthur Curry: Half-brother.

Nudis Vulko: He's trying to fan the flames of war with the surface. He lies! The snatchers have come from the Dark Place, they're looking for it. The Motherbox our people guard is not safe. Go to the Stronghold of Atlantis. Protect the box. The time has come! Take up your mother's trident!

Nudis Vulko: You can't turn your back on the world forever, Arthur. Above, or below.

Steppenwolf: DeSaad? DeSaad! I call to thee.

[DeSaad reveals himself in some sort of hologram.]

DeSaad: Steppenwolf?

DeSaad: Have you begun the conquest?

Steppenwolf: This world is divided. They're a primitive species, unevolved and at war with one another, too separate to be one.

Steppenwolf: Their free will must be ripped from them, like the other worlds. Given...absolution in one glorious belief: to serve him.

DeSaad: The Motherboxes?

Steppenwolf: I have found one of the three. The one that woke and called to me.

Steppenwolf: The other two still sleep but the Parademons feel their presence.

Steppenwolf: They fly, they search, they take prisoners who carry the scent while I build a stronghold in the name of his glory.

DeSaad: Yes. Mighty Steppenwolf...

DeSaad:...who might have sat here by the side of the Great One...

DeSaad:...but undone by his self-pride.

Steppenwolf: DeSaad...I fall before you.

Steppenwolf: Let me make a plea to him, that I may come home...after I take this world, in his name.

DeSaad: YOU BETRAYED HIM.

DeSaad: Your own family...-

Steppenwolf: I SAW MY MISTAKE! I slaughtered those who sought his throne!

DeSaad: You still owe the Great One 50.000 more worlds.

[Steppenwolf looks saddened and defeated.]

DeSaad: He will hear your plea...when you pay your debt.

Steppenwolf: The Motherboxes will be found and united.

DeSaad: No Protectors here. No Lanterns. No Kryptonian.

DeSaad: This world will fall, like all the others.

DeSaad: For Darkseid.

Steppenwolf: For Darkseid...

Bruce Wayne: You know, I paid millions of dollars for this building's security?

Diana Prince: You got your money's worth. Took me almost a minute to disable it.

Bruce Wayne: Hi, there.

Diana Prince: A new toy?

Bruce Wayne: Prototype troop carrier.

Diana Prince: I once knew a man who would love to fly it...

Bruce Wayne: Best minds at Wayne Aerospace couldn't make it fly.

Diana Prince: But you can?

Bruce Wayne: I have no choice. I need more range and I need more cargo. I think there's an attack coming.

Diana Prince: Not "coming", Bruce. It's already here.

Diana Prince: From what I've learned, there are things from another universe. They serve a dark power. An old power.

Bruce Wayne: What do they want?

Diana Prince: To invade. To conquer. They came here once before, long ago.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] A great armada appeared in the sky, laying waste to all who opposed it. The leader of the invaders was a being called "Darkseid", a name cursed and feared in every universe.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] Darkseid was met in battle by Earth's defenders -- the Old Gods, Men, Atlanteans, before their descent into the sea, Amazons, before their betrayal and enslavement, and guardians from the stars.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] Their histories had taught them not to trust each other, not to hope for an alliance. To fight apart.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] As Darkseid waged war on Earth, he found a secret there. A power, hidden in the infinity of space. He called forth mystics who worshipped and controlled three objects -- the Motherboxes.

Bruce Wayne: Wait, wait, wait. Motherboxes?

Diana Prince: Indestructible living machines, made from a science so advanced it looks like sorcery.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] To conquer, three boxes have to synchronize and join together into The Unity. The Unity cleanses a planet with fire, transforming it into a copy of the enemy's world. All who live become servants of Darkseid, alive but drained of life. Parademons.

Queen Hippolyta: Amazons!

The Ancient King of Men: With me!

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] But before The Unity could synchronize, the Defenders of Earth attacked and fought as one. Amazons alongside Atlanteans. Zeus and his son, Ares, alongside the guardians from the sky. A golden age of heroes fighting together to defend life on Earth.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] They did what no world had ever done -- sent the enemies back into the stars. The three Motherboxes never synchronized. The Unity never came to pass. But, in their retreat, the boxes were left behind on Earth. They grew weak -- dogs without masters, falling asleep, awaiting their return. Fading from the view of the enemy, anonymous among a trillion worlds.

Diana Prince: [Voice-Over] The Defenders of Earth made a vow -- Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons. Each would enshrine and guard the three sleeping Motherboxes according to the rights and rituals of their culture in case a box should ever wake again to call out to the planet Apokolips to return and conquer the only world Darkseid had ever lost.

Diana Prince: Something woke the box my people guarded. It called out to the Dark Place, to one of Darkseid's conquerers. The enemy is here.

Bruce Wayne: If he's here, where is he?

Diana Prince: He'll be searching for the other two boxes, hiding until he has all three -- until it's ready.

Bruce Wayne: Then we have to be ready. You, me, the others...

Diana Prince: They said the Age of Heroes would never come again.

Bruce Wayne: Oh, no. It has to.

Diana Prince: The others -- where are they?
Part 3: Beloved Mother, Beloved Son

Barry Allen: Am I late? No, I'm so late. I'm very late. Oh, hey buddy! Hey! Oh.

Barry Allen: No?

Barry Allen: Here-- I'm so sorry! I'm-- late.

Dog Daycare Owner: Are you, uh--?

Barry Allen: I'm so sorry I'm so late, I didn't meant to be so late, I'm me and I'm here and I'm so sorry I'm late. Essentially, the bus didn't come, then the bus did come, but then there was this old woman counting change for the fair like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny, like, "jeez, louise, let this woman on the bus! She's a hundred seven years old, these are some of her last few moments of life--"

Dog Daycare Owner: Resumé?

Barry Allen: Resumé.

Iris West: Oh, come on. Come on...

Barry Allen: From the French, of course! Resumé, I believe, the past participle of--

Barry Allen: Oh, well, that's no good. I mean, it's like, what lives in my pocket, right? "Paper monster hungry!" It--

Barry Allen: Alright.

Iris West: Come on! We're supposed to be friends now.

Iris West: Yes!

Barry Allen: Central City College. I'm a Criminal Justice Major.

Dog Daycare Owner: I thought you said experience walking dogs.

Barry Allen: Oh, gosh, I hope everyone's okay! See, in times of crisis, for dog work, I always bring a meat snack, 'cause it makes me feel calm. You never know what's gonna happen in the city! I mean, oh, my gosh! Right? I start on Monday?

Steppenwolf: You have been near a Motherbox. Her scent is on you. Where is it?

Atlantean Soldier: No son or daughter of Atlantis will ever tell you!

Atlantean Soldier: Our people have guarded the Motherbox for thousands of years...

Atlantean Soldier: I will never betray my own people!

Steppenwolf: You already have.

Diana Prince: This was taken in the deepest trench on Earth. He must be an Atlantean -- a water breather.

Bruce Wayne: He was breathing air when I talked to him.

Diana Prince: Mixed blood, then. He said he'll fight with us?

Bruce Wayne: More or less.

Diana Prince: More "more", or more "less".

Bruce Wayne: Probably more "less".

Diana Prince: He said "no".

Bruce Wayne: He said "no".

Diana Prince: Atlanteans can be tricky. My people went to war with them once. I'm not sure we can trust him.

Bruce Wayne: Diana, if we're gonna do this, you're gonna need to be open to more things than--

Bruce Wayne: Yeah. Sorry--

Diana Prince: I'm sorry. It's okay.

Bruce Wayne: My fault. Don't worry about it. Happens.

Diana Prince: So--

Bruce Wayne: This is the third person. Disappears for one-thirtieth of a second here. One frame of video, see?

Diana Prince: "Barry Allen, Central City." Go to him, I'll work on number four. "Organic and Biomechatronic body parts"... He's a cyborg.

Coach: Ready!

Gotham City University Football Team: Break!

Victor Stone: Three! Eighty! Set! Go!

College Dean: Your son may be captain of the football team and a certified genius, Mrs. Stone--

Ellinor Stone: Doctor Stone.

College Dean: But that doesn't mean he can hack into our system to change his friends' grades.

Ellinor Stone: Sarah's family lost her house this year. How could that child pass her classes? Victor helped her 'cause he's got a good heart. What did you do to help her?

Ellinor Stone: Your father...

Victor Stone: Mom, Mom, don't, I...

Ellinor Stone: He got held up at the lab.

Victor Stone: He always does.

Ellinor Stone: He wanted to be here...

Victor Stone: You always say that! Ma, you gotta stop making excuses for him. You're just as busy as he is, but you still make the time.

Ellinor Stone: He just has difficulties showing it, but he's proud of you. We both are, Victor. Hey, hey, hey, hey! With everything I know you can do today, I can't wait to see what you're gonna be tomorrow.

Emergency Room Doctor: Doctor Stone, I'm sorry. Your wife didn't survive. I'm afraid your son won't, either.

Silas Stone: I won't let you die! I won't allow it! I won't allow it...

Silas Stone: Victor. Victor, you're not... stuck in here. You still have a life ahead of you. Your mother would've wanted you to live that life.

Victor Stone: If you were there, Mom would still be alive.

Silas Stone: Alright, look. You don't have to give me a second chance, but give yourself one. If you can't stand looking at me, try listening.

Silas Stone: [Recorded] --what you can do now, Victor. Your physical strength is just the tip of the iceberg. The tip of the tip.

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] In a world of ones and zeroes, you are the absolute master. No firewall can stop you. No encryption can defy you. We're all at your mercy, Vic. From our power grids to our telecommunications, everyone's lives are controlled and dominated by complex digital networks that will bend, without effort, to your will.

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] The fate of the world will literally rest in your hands.

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] Its entire nuclear arsenal, you could launch with a thought.

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] The world's monetary systems and its complex interactions will seem as easy to manipulate for you as a child's plaything.

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] The question-- No, the challenge... Won't be doing it. It will be not doing. Not seeing. It is the burden of this responsibility that will define you and who you choose to be.

Linda Reed: [Recording] Now, make a wish.

Linda Reed: [Recording] One more time.

Linda Reed: [Recording] Good job! Now wave to Grandma!

Linda Reed's son: [Recording] Hi, Grandma!

Linda Reed: Wha- Won?! Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god, it--! Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

Silas Stone: [Voice Over] Victor... Victor, these are the words and deductions of a scientist. That's how I've been speaking to you. Now...

Silas Stone: [Recorded] Let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist. As a father.

Homeless Man: Hey! Hey, you!

Henry Allen: Because you are holding yourself back. You're going in circles, man. Holding down three dead-end jobs, going on four? Where do you even find the time...?

Barry Allen: I make the time. I just need one more gig...

Henry Allen: Barry.

Barry Allen: ...and then I'm gonna pay for my own tuition.

Henry Allen: You can't.

Barry Allen: Like I always said I would.

Henry Allen: You can not keep doing this to yourself.

Barry Allen: Okay, I really don't want to talk about this again, please. We have ten minutes.

Henry Allen: And this is all to pay for a Criminal Justice Degree, huh?

Barry Allen: Yeah.

Henry Allen: For what?

Barry Allen: Huh. Let's see, as I talk to my father who's still in prison for the murder of my mother which he didn't commit-- Yeah, how did I get interested in Criminal Justice? I can't remember.

Henry Allen: Oh, boy...

Barry Allen: This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

Henry Allen: Gimme your hand, man.

Henry Allen: I want you to listen to me, Barry. I want you to listen to me, because I mean this... I want you to give all that up. And I want you to stop coming to see me. I am a drag on your life.

Barry Allen: Okay, um... Please don't ever say that to me again. Please?

Henry Allen: Hey, you know what Criminal Justice would be for me? My son, not wasting his life. You can be whatever you want to be. You're brilliant, man. Absolute best of the best. I can't sit here and watch you run in place in Central City for some old dude who's not going anywhere.

Barry Allen: Dad... That's not true.

Prison Guard: Time.

Barry Allen: That's not true!

Prison Guard: Let's go, Allen. Allen!

Henry Allen: I want you to make your own future, you're living in the past-- Make your own future!

Prison Guard: Open gate!

Barry Allen: Great.

Barry Allen: "Living in the past, you have no future, Barry."

Bruce Wayne: Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

Barry Allen: You say that like it explains why there's a total stranger, in my place, sitting in the dark, in my second favorite chair.

Bruce Wayne: Tell me about this.

Barry Allen: This is a person who looks exactly like me but who is definitely not. Me. Somebody... I dunno, hippie? Long hair? Very attractive Jewish boy. He drinks milk, I don't drink milk.

Bruce Wayne: I know you have abilities. I just don't know what they are.

Barry Allen: My special skills include, uh, viola. Uh, web design. Sign language. Gorilla sign language.

Bruce Wayne: Silica-based, sand quartz fabric. Abrasion-resistant. Heat resistant.

Barry Allen: Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

Bruce Wayne: That's what they use on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.

Barry Allen: I do very competitive ice dancing. Look, man, I don't know who you are, but whoever you're looking for? It's not me.

Barry Allen: You're the Batman?

Bruce Wayne: So, you're fast.

Barry Allen: That feels like an oversimplification.

Bruce Wayne: I'm putting together a team. People with special abilities. You see, I believe enemies are coming--

Barry Allen: Stop right there! I'm in!

Bruce Wayne: You are? Just like that?

Barry Allen: Yeah, I-- I need... Friends.

Bruce Wayne: Great! Great.

Barry Allen: Can I keep this?

Barry Allen: It's like this layer of dimensional reality that seems to manipulate space-time. I call it the Speed Force. Causes me to burn a tremendous amount of calories... So I am just a black hole of snacks. I am a "snack hole." How many people are on this special fight team?

Bruce Wayne: Three. Including you.

Barry Allen: Three? Against what?

Bruce Wayne: I'll tell you on the plane.

Barry Allen: Plane?

Barry Allen: What are your superpowers again?

Bruce Wayne: I'm rich.

Alfred Pennyworth: Oh! Miss Prince, let me do that.

Diana Prince: No, that's okay. I can do it myself. Would you like to have some?

Alfred Pennyworth: Ah, no thank you. If you put the water in first...

Diana Prince: Of course.

Alfred Pennyworth: So we don't scald the tea. Yes.

Diana Prince: Great.

Alfred Pennyworth: Now, that's probably enough tea.

Diana Prince: All right. Are you sure you don't wanna have some?

Alfred Pennyworth: I won't, thank you. And then leave it to mash.

Diana Prince: I will. I will. Definitely will. Uh, what are you working on?

Alfred Pennyworth: Uh, it's a gauntlet! Lined with specialized polymer solar cells.

Diana Prince: Ah.

Alfred Pennyworth: Here, let me show you. We borrowed this from the Kryptonian Scout Ship. Hah! Oh-- Maybe you should, uh... A fraction, if you would be so kind.

Diana Prince: Of course.

Alfred Pennyworth: Thank you.

Alfred Pennyworth: Ah! Ah, now, let's see how that did... Hah! Yes. Not to be sneezed at!

Diana Prince: A gauntlet that captures and dissipates energy...

Alfred Pennyworth: It was Master Wayne's idea.

Diana Prince: Maybe you should work on a lasso, too. In black, of course.

Diana Prince: Alright. Victor... Stone.

Diana Prince: Something is not working.

Alfred Pennyworth: Hm.

Alfred Pennyworth: Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.

Cyborg: Why are you looking for me, Diana?

Diana Prince: You know who I am?

Cyborg: I know more than you could possibly imagine.

Diana Prince: Then maybe you already know we need your help. The world does.

Cyborg: Fuck the world.

Diana Prince: You've obviously been through a great deal. I can't begin to imagine what. But whatever happened to you, you have gifts now.

Cyborg: Gifts? What part of this looks like a gift to you?

Diana Prince: We need you, Victor. And maybe you need us.

Cyborg: I don't need anyone. Not any more.

Diana Prince: I told myself the same for a long time. I lost someone I loved, once. I shut myself off from... From everyone. But I had to learn to open back up again. The truth is, I'm still working on it. And if you asked to meet me...

Diana Prince: You're working on it, too.

Ryan Choi: You were right about the metal from the Superman ship. When we bombard it with x-rays from the Electron Laser... look what happens.

Silas Stone: Three point five million Kelvin?

Ryan Choi: The inner core of the metal becomes superheated. Hot, dense matter. You're looking at the hottest thing on Earth. Exact words I said to my prom date. She dumped me, anyway.

Silas Stone: Yeah.

Ryan Choi: Hey, Doc? Do you think Batman is connected to the object the CID is looking for? You know, 61982?

Silas Stone: No, I don't.

Silas Stone: Oh, Victor.

Female GCPD Officer: Commissioner Gordon? Your messages.

Commissioner Gordon: Don't have to see the sky to know it's a full moon.

Crispus Allen: Half of Gotham's reality-challenged community showed up, said they saw flying monsters by the harbor.

Commissioner Gordon: You were right, ma. "Police Academy? What's wrong with dental school?"

Commissioner Gordon: "Attacked by a flying vampire... Looked like a giant bat with huge fangs..."

Crispus Allen: On a possibly related note, sketch of the suspect in the abductions of the lab across the harbor. Looks like--

Commissioner Gordon: I know what it looks like, Crispus. Come on, you think he fights criminals for twenty years here then goes to Metropolis and kidnaps eight people? I'll talk to him tonight.

Crispus Allen: How, Jim?

Commissioner Gordon: How do you think?

Silas Stone: Hang on! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

Barry Allen: Oh. My gosh.

Bruce Wayne: Where's the Cyborg?

Diana Prince: His name is Victor. We met. Spoke. Give him time. You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

Barry Allen: Hi, Barry, I'm Diana. That's not right. Great.

Diana Prince: So, this is us.

Bruce Wayne: Yeah, this is us.

Barry Allen: Oh! Awesome! That's the Bat Signal, that's your-- Ooh, shh, sorry, that's your signal! That means we have to go now!

Bruce Wayne: Yeah, that's-- That's what that means.

Barry Allen: It's so cool!

Atlantean Perimeter Guard: Commander Mera. I told the King the perimeter guards were taken. He won't send reinforcements, he says all reserves are needed in the rebel regions!

Mera: He's as shortsighted as he is cruel. Alright, take what men we have left and form a phalanx around the Motherbox.

Steppenwolf: You can't escape.

Mera: I'm not trying to!

Mera: Vulko told me you would come. The firstborn of the Beloved Queen Atlanna.

Mera: Wait! Please. I knew her.

Arthur Curry: Well, that makes one of us.

Mera: My parents died in the wars. She took me in.

Arthur Curry: What a saint.

Mera: You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way?!

Arthur Curry: Your Queen left me on my father's doorstep and never gave me another thought.

Mera: Your mother left you to save your life. You cannot imagine how it hurt her. What it cost her. But you're not a defenseless child now. It would've been her responsibility to follow that monster to the surface and stop him. Now, it's yours.

Arthur Curry: Hm.

Steppenwolf: Yes...

DeSaad: Steppenwolf. Tell me what you've learned.

Steppenwolf: Two boxes, found and awake! With the combined power of the Motherboxes, I've been able to finish the stronghold's defenses.

DeSaad: Where is the third Motherbox?

Steppenwolf: The Parademons sense its presence and search for the third. They have taken prisoners who carry its scent.

DeSaad: Go. Interrogate the prisoners. Find the third.

Steppenwolf: They will tell me what they know... or I will rip it from them.
Part 4: "Change Machine"

Commissioner Gordon: How many of you are there?

Batman: Not enough.

Commissioner Gordon: Dozens of witnesses all over Gotham. Description matches the suspect in the Metropolis abductions.

Wonder Woman: Parademons.

The Flash: Okay?

Wonder Woman: The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box.

The Flash: At the lab.

Wonder Woman: They carried people away to find out what they know.

Batman: So the eight may still be alive.

Cyborg: Nine. The head of S.T.A.R. Labs was taken tonight.

Commissioner Gordon: Wow. Okay. So, another scientist.

Cyborg: So how do we find them?

Wonder Woman: There must be a nest nearby.

Commissioner Gordon: I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham... No discernible pattern I can see. The lines on the map don't converge.

Cyborg: On land. These lead back to Stryker's Island, between the two cities.

Batman: These are air vents... they all lead down to the tunnel from Metropolis project, it was abandoned in '29.

Wonder Woman: The nest could be there.

The Flash: Uh... Is he coming with us now? Because we're not all gonna fit in your car.

Batman: I have something bigger.

Commissioner Gordon: Do you really think that--

The Flash: Oh, wow. They just... They really just vanished, huh? Oh, that's rude.

Wonder Woman: We're close. The scent of the enemy. Of absence. Darkness. Death.

Batman: Where are we, Alfred?

Alfred Pennyworth: Stryker's Island. You should be... directly under the venting tower for the tunnel. Now, look to your left, you'll see a staircase to the machine room. Thermal scan shows a cluster of people there.

Batman: That's it. Let's go.

The Flash: Right. Uh... Is there- Is there a plan? Either of you?

Wonder Woman: Don't engage alone. We do this together.

Cyborg: I heard about you. Didn't think you were real.

Bruce Wayne: I'm real when it's useful.

Steppenwolf: I grow tired of your silence! Now tell me, where is the Motherbox?!

S.T.A.R. Labs Scientist: Please! We have families!

Steppenwolf: Then you have weakness.

Wonder Woman: Steppenwolf...

The Flash: Okay, so I'm guessing... that's the bad guy.

Batman: Good guess.

The Flash: I'm really, really missing Superman right now.

Wonder Woman: Circle to the other side. We'll surround them and surprise them.

Steppenwolf: You have been near a Motherbox. Her scent is on you.

S.T.A.R. Labs Scientist: I don't know what you're talking about!

Steppenwolf: Where is it?!

Silas Stone: Leave them alone! He- He doesn't know!

Steppenwolf: You carry the scent, too, but stronger.

Silas Stone: I'll die before I tell you!

Steppenwolf: You'll die if you don't!

Cyborg: No!

Silas Stone: Victor!

Steppenwolf: Kill them both.

Steppenwolf: Ah! Amazon. But not like your sisters. Stronger.

Steppenwolf: Amazon! Argh!

Steppenwolf: Hold! This one will be mine.

Wonder Woman: I belong to no one!

The Flash: Guys! This is not "together"!

Batman: Help get those people out of here! I'll make sure these things follow me!

Cyborg: Everybody, move!

The Flash: A little quicker!

The Flash: You good?

Silas Stone: Yeah.

Cyborg: I've got this, keep moving!

The Flash: This way!

Alfred Pennyworth: The energy is dissipating. My gauntlet worked!

Batman: Celebrate later, Alfred! I need the Nightcrawler!

Alfred Pennyworth: Thought you'd never ask. Crawler's on the way, initiating Remote Mode.

Batman: Thank you, Alfred.

Alfred Pennyworth: Don't mention it.

The Flash: No!

Cyborg: They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

The Flash: Tunnel, right. Aliens, bad guys, sword lady!

Batman: My turn.

Alfred Pennyworth: Catastrophic failure of all systems. Are you alright, Master Wayne?

Alfred Pennyworth: Are you alright?

Steppenwolf: You have the blood of the Old Gods in you.

Cyborg: You okay?

Silas Stone: Mm-hm. Wasn't sure you'd come.

Cyborg: You're my father.

Silas Stone: Go.

The Flash: No! Help!

Cyborg: Relax, Alfred. I'll take it from here.

Alfred Pennyworth: Uh, d- Do I know you?

The Flash: What're we under right now?

Batman: Gotham Harbor...

The Flash: Who is that?

Cyborg: Come on!

Cyborg: Diana! Get on!

[Steppenwolf takes a Boom Tube back to his fortress, having been called by the Motherboxes.]

Steppenwolf: What is it?

[He approaches them.]

Steppenwolf: Show me.

[He places his hand in the second Motherbox and feels a surge of energy that teleports him somewhere.]

[He then digs some dirt out of the ground.]

Steppenwolf: It is here...on this...world!

[He slams his axe into the ground, causing a shockwave to reveal the Anti-Life Equation.]

[Steppenwolf is visibly shocked by this revelation, and roars victoriously.]

Biohazard Suit Soldier: Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine for possible alien microbes. US Government Protocols require that--

Silas Stone: I know the requirements. I wrote them.

Wonder Woman: It called to him -- the Motherbox. The one he already has.

Aquaman: He has two. He took the Motherbox from Atlantis.

Wonder Woman: All he needs now is the last Box of Man.

Batman: If he doesn't already have it.

Cyborg: He doesn't have it. I do.

[Meanwhile...]

DeSaad: Have you finished the conquest?

Steppenwolf: Not yet, DeSaad.

DeSaad: Then why have you summoned me?

Steppenwolf: I bring news!

Steppenwolf: Before Mighty Darkseid came to the throne, he searched the universe for the ultimate weapon -- the Anti-Life Equation. The key to controlling all life and all will throughout the multiverse. He found it, hidden on a primitive planet, but before-

DeSaad: The story of the defiance is well known.

Steppenwolf: I have found the primitive planet! The world that fought back!

Steppenwolf: It is Earth. The Anti-Life Equation is carved into the surface of this very world.

[Beat.]

DeSaad: Are you certain?

Steppenwolf: I have seen it. I have looked with my own eyes.

DeSaad: Domine...

Steppenwolf: On Anti-Life.

DeSaad: Qui infernum conflegrit...

DeSaad: [???]

[He steps away from the hologram after his prayer, leaving Steppenwolf confused.]

[As numerous parademons arrive and bow down, he turns around and sees the great one himself show up.]

[The mere sight of him causes Steppenwolf to fall on his knees.]

Steppenwolf: My lord...

[He bows down, and withdraws his armor.]

Darkseid: Oh, Steppenwolf...

Steppenwolf: My lord, I am but your humble servant.

Darkseid: Can it be true that you have found it?

Steppenwolf: I have, Great One.

Steppenwolf: The lost world...is Earth. Anti-Life...is here.

Darkseid: If it is redemption you seek, find the third box, synchronize The Unity, and when this world is scorched, I will come for my great prize.

[Steppenwolf's eyes widen at his words.]

Steppenwolf: You will come to Earth?

Darkseid: I have turned one hundred thousand worlds to dust, looking for Anti-Life, looking for those who robbed me of my glory.

Darkseid: I will stride across their bones and bask in the glow of Anti-Life, and all of existence...shall be mine.

[Beat.]

Steppenwolf: It shall be so...my master.

The Flash: So cool! From the outside, it looked like this building was abandoned!

Victor Stone: It wants to fly...

Aquaman: You talk to machines?

Victor Stone: I speak to intelligence. This one's saying she can't fly because of a software issue, but I can fix it with a little time.

Victor Stone: There's a dark spot in my data stream. I can feel the other two boxes. I know they're awake. But I can't see where they are.

Arthur Curry: Well, we can't attack unless we know where the base is.

Diana Prince: Even if we knew, I've never seen a being as strong as Steppenwolf. Maybe one.

The Flash: Mm. Superman.

Victor Stone: As long as the third box is asleep, they can't see it. Only sense it. We need to keep moving so they can't catch up.

Bruce Wayne: No. That's just a strategy to lose more slowly. Not to win.

The Flash: Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing? Why don't we just destroy it?

Victor Stone: Fire doesn't destroy the boxes. They're an unknown form of matter. Now, they love heat. They absorb it. Hold it in their cores.

Arthur Curry: You know a lot about these boxes. Makes you think.

Bruce Wayne: Where'd you find the box, Victor?

Victor Stone: Hold on, are you trying to say something?

Arthur Curry: Oh, I'm saying it. How do we know you're not working for them?

Victor Stone: It's a long story.

Arthur Curry: You got somewhere else to be?

Victor Stone: The Nazis found the Box at the end of the Second World War, buried under an Italian monastery.

Victor Stone: The Allies intercepted it on its way to Hitler. They brought it back to the States in '44. Unknown Object 61982. It collected dust in the Pentagon Archives for 70 years.

Victor Stone: [Voice Over] 'Till DOD began to study the Superman ship. The head researcher at S.T.A.R. Labs made a connection between the ship and 61982.

Victor Stone: [Voice Over] He understood they were both alien technologies. Different civilizations, similar properties. And though the box had slept for thousands of years, the researcher formulated a theory on how to awaken it, and so did.

Victor Stone: Then... I had an accident that should've killed me. But in an act of desperation and madness, the researcher harnessed the power of the Motherbox.

Victor Stone: He unleashed an alien technology he didn't fully understand. He used that power to keep me alive.

Victor Stone: Alive... But turned into this. The Box went back to sleep, and he never returned it. That researcher was Silas Stone. My father.

Barry Allen: Wait. Your father saved your life with one of these things? A-Aren't they psycho murder machines?

Victor Stone: They're Change Machines. The Boxes don't think in terms of healing or killing, alive or dead. They rearrange matter at the will of their masters. Regenerate. Reinstate.

Diana Prince: Reinstate?

Victor Stone: The Box has the power to reinstate anterior particle relationships.

Barry Allen: So you mean in the way that particles can't be created or destroyed, their relationships just transform?

Victor Stone: Burn down the house, the particles still exist. Particles of house becomes particles of smoke.

Diana Prince: Anybody with a match can turn the house to smoke.

Arthur Curry: But a Motherbox...

Bruce Wayne: Turns smoke back into a house.

Barry Allen: I know we're all thinking the same thing right now.

Barry Allen: Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.

[Cyborg shows a hologram of Superman taking off.]

[The plan has been made clear: To resurrect Superman with the Motherbox they have.]

Lois Lane: Who is it?

Martha Kent: Martha.

Martha Kent: I went to the Daily Planet to finally pick up Clark's things. I don't know why. Nowhere to put them now. I lost the farm. I'd been behind on the payments for a while. Truth is, the house is too big for me to live in by myself, anyway.

Lois Lane: Well, you know, you're welcome to stay here any time for as long as you need.

Martha Kent: Thank you, Lois, that's very kind. But I found a little place that suits me just fine, right by the diner. I'm not here for help. I'm here because... when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that... You haven't been to work since Clark died?

Lois Lane: I can't.

Martha Kent: The whole world is mourning. Grieving over a symbol. Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I see that "S". I hear what people say. They talk like they knew him. But they didn't know Clark. And I can't stop 'em, and look at 'em, and tell 'em how proud I am of my son! You're the only one who knows -- who feels what I do. Burdened by a secret on top of grief. I came all this way because I wanted-- Because I wanted to see you. Tell you, I understand.

Lois Lane: I... will never love anybody the way that I love your son. And I just miss him. I miss him so much.

Martha Kent: So do I, sweetheart.

Lois Lane: Martha, you know... if there's anything you need, I'm here.

Martha Kent: There is something you can do for me, honey. Come back to the living.

Calvin Swanwick / Martian Manhunter: The world needs you, too, Lois.

Arthur Curry: The dead are dead.

Diana Prince: The box brought Victor back...

Arthur Curry: Victor wasn't dead. Life is either one or zero, it's "to be" or "not to be". Not both.

Bruce Wayne: Can you operate this box, Victor?

Victor Stone: Of course. But we don't know enough about Kryptonian biology. There's no telling what's gonna happen.

Barry Allen: Okay, but... I mean, we have to try! Don't we? We- We have to try! What do we have to lose?

Diana Prince: We cannot try unless we activate the box. As soon as it wakes up...

Bruce Wayne: The enemy sees it, comes, activates The Unity... The end.

Barry Allen: So, what we have to lose is the entire planet to a bunch of genocidal aliens. That's good to know.

Arthur Curry: Even if Superman could return, who's to say that he could defeat them?

Bruce Wayne: The Motherbox did. Victor's father activated a Motherbox more than a year ago, when Superman was still alive. Didn't call out to Steppenwolf. None of the Motherboxes did. Not until S-

Diana Prince: Not until Superman died.

Bruce Wayne: Not until Superman died...

Barry Allen: It's like they were afraid of him.

Bruce Wayne: Yes. They were afraid of him. This is the only way. There are six, not five. There is no "us" without him.
Part 5: All The King's Horses

Barry Allen: Cross this one off the bucket list! "Exhume Superman from the grave". Check! You know we could do this in a nanosecond, right?

Victor Stone: We could.

Barry Allen: He was my hero... Alright.

Diana Prince: An Amazon working with an Atlantean...

Arthur Curry: Half Atlantean.

Diana Prince: How many thousands of years since our people spoke?

Arthur Curry: I don't know know. I'm not exactly close to mine. I hate Atlanteans as much as you Amazons do.

Diana Prince: Hate is useless.

Arthur Curry: Yep.

Diana Prince: No, thank you.

Arthur Curry: You know, my father told me there's a saying in Atlantis: "None are taken back from the darkness. Not without..."

Diana Prince: "Not without giving one up in return." We say the same thing.

Arthur Curry: How 'bout that?

Barry Allen: Wonder Woman! What do you think, man? You think she'd ever... go for a younger guy?

Victor Stone: She's 5,000 years old, Barry. Every guy's a younger guy.

Alfred Pennyworth: Ah, Christ.

Alfred Pennyworth: Oh, bloody-!

Bruce Wayne: Any luck?

Alfred Pennyworth: If by "luck", you mean "chance in hell we're getting it flying today", then no. No luck.

Bruce Wayne: It's okay. Doesn't matter, we're just gonna take the body to the Kryptonian ship, it's bascially an organic computer. It can talk directly to the Motherbox.

Alfred Pennyworth: What, the way it talked to Lex Luthor?

Bruce Wayne: Something like that.

Alfred Pennyworth: Oh. What could possibly go wrong?

Alfred Pennyworth: Master Wayne. You did it! You put the team together to fight this war! You've fulfilled your promise. But to try and do that? I mean... Your guilt's overcome your reason. "Not all the king's horses, nor all the king's men could--"

Bruce Wayne: Alfred, for once, I'm operating on strictly on faith, not on reason.

Alfred Pennyworth: But if you start playing with this little box of tricks, I mean, it... could be the end of everything. How do you know your team's strong enough? If you can't bring down the charging bull, then don't wave the red cape at it.

Bruce Wayne: You do when it's this red cape. This red cape charges back.

Diana Prince: Okay.

Thomas: You were right, Doctor Stone. The tests came back negative. Everyone's clear, including you. Just to be on the safe side, we swept the entire facility.

Silas Stone: Thank you, Thomas. That means I'm free to go?

Thomas: Absolutely.

Thomas: Listen, everyone: you're all clear gather your things, if you need more medical attention...

Barry Allen: Arthur, yes, your opinion. Less preposterous: Option A?

Arthur Curry: Definitely not A.

Barry Allen: Okay. Or, B?

Arthur Curry: Let me see A again?

Diana Prince: Right. We should get dressed.

Cyborg: I'm always dressed.

Guard Soldier: ID.

Barry Allen: ID.

Barry Allen: Aye, aye.

Barry Allen: "Aye, aye?"

Guard Soldier: Okay.

Barry Allen: Okay? Oh, gee, okay!

Ryan Choi: Doc! They let you out of quarantine!

Silas Stone: Yeah, I finally got them to listen to reason. Now, let's, uh, take a look at the progress we've made with the Electron Laser.

Ryan Choi: We've made some real progress. Let me show you.

Batman: Victor, clear this place out.

Cyborg: Done.

Announcement System: Code Red. Containment breach. All personnel, evacuate immediately.

Ryan Choi: Bio red Five. A sensor is picking up a microbe of alien origin.

Silas Stone: A microbe of alien origin? That doesn't make any sense! It's gotta be a false alarm.

Ryan Choi: Alright, people, shut it down. Let's go.

Silas Stone: Ryan, we just had it swept!

Ryan Choi: We have to go, Doc.

Silas Stone: Think about it, it's gotta be a false alarm!

Ryan Choi: We have to go!

Silas Stone: Think about it!

Woman: Full base evacuation! Everyone out!

Silas Stone: Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

PA Announcer: Remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit. Attention, all personnel...

Guards: Go! Go! Everybody out! Come on! Move! Move! Come on! Go, go! Everybody out! Go!

Silas Stone: Yes! Gotcha. Post Commander, this is Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

Post Commander: Go ahead, Dr. Stone.

Silas Stone: This is a false alarm. Someone has hacked into the system, we must alert--

Silas Stone: Victor...

Post Commander: Dr. Stone, you there? I don't copy.

Silas Stone: I was mistaken. The alarm's legit. Everybody out, And nobody, I repeat, nobody comes back inside without my say-so.

Post Commander: Roger that, sir.

Officer One: Get the civillians out!

Officer Two: Let's go!

Silas Stone: Everybody got out okay?

Ryan Choi: I think so.

Silas Stone: Everybody?

Ryan Choi: Yes.

Cyborg: This way.

The Flash: It knows he's here. Ooh, that's intense.

Cyborg: This is amazing...

Aquaman: This is crazy.

The Flash: Oh, what, now it's crazy?

Aquaman: You two lunatics better know what you're doing.

Scout Ship AI: Systems coming online. Welcome, Victor. Would you like to assume command?

Cyborg: I'm in.

Cyborg: The ship says the Motherbox is hostile. I can override the security protocols, but there's no time to repair all the electrical damage that Luthor's power surges caused to the primary capacitors.

Aquaman: English.

Cyborg: There's not enough charge to wake the box.

The Flash: I might be able to do it. I mean, I- I might be able to jumpstart it. I- I don't like to break this rule, but when I approach the speed of light, I-- look, crazy things happen to time, but if I do it, I create massive electrical power. I can backtrack. If I can get enough distance, I can conduct a significant enough electrical current, I- I might be able to wake the box, if that's...s-still what we want?

Batman: It is. Do it.

Officer Jimmy: Hey, Miss Lane!

Lois Lane: Morning.

Officer Jimmy: I didn't think you were coming.

Lois Lane: One last time.

The Flash: That's the engine, so... This must be the end of the line, so I'm... I'm in position.

Scout Ship AI: Ready to initiate drop sequence.

Cyborg: The Motherbox is ready.

Cyborg: The ship's begging me not to wake the box.

Scout Ship AI: This action is irreversible.

Cyborg: It's afraid. It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

Batman: We know that already. Continue.

Scout Ship AI: I strongly advise against activation.

Cyborg: Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

Scout Ship AI: This action is irreversible.

Cyborg: Five.

Scout Ship AI: Five.

The Flash: Five.

Scout Ship AI: Apokoliptian technology is hostile.

Aquaman: This is a bad idea.

Batman: No, it isn't. Keep going.

Cyborg: Four.

Scout Ship AI: Four.

The Flash: Four...

Scout Ship AI: I strongly advise against activation.

Aquaman: We need to abort, now!

Batman: Just do it!

Cyborg: Three.

Scout Ship AI: Three.

The Flash: Three.

Cyborg: Two.

Scout Ship AI: Two.

The Flash: Two.

Scout Ship AI: This course is irreversible.

Cyborg: One.

Scout Ship AI: One.

The Flash: One...

Scout Ship AI: This action is irreversible.

The Flash: Victor?

Cyborg: No...

The Flash: Go?!

Scout Ship AI: The future has taken root in the present.

Cyborg: Get down!

Wonder Woman: He's back...

Cyborg: Something's wrong. He's scanning us...

The Flash: What?

The Flash: Victor? Victor!

Cyborg: Shit!

Aquaman: What're you doing?!

Cyborg: It's my armor's defense systems! It senses danger!

The Flash: Victor, no! Victor!

Cyborg: I can't control it!

The Flash: Victor, don't!

Wonder Woman: Kal-El, no!

Wonder Woman: He's confused, he doesn't know who he is!

Wonder Woman: Arthur, we need to restrain him!

Wonder Woman: Kal-El. The last son of Krypton. Remember who you are. Tell me who you--

Cyborg: You should probably move.

Batman: You alright? Get up! Take cover back there!

[Clark's heat vision lights up.]

Batman: Clark... Clark, no!

[Clark activates it and Batman catches it on one of his gauntlets. The laser blasts him back into a Metropolis PD car, denting it. Batman rips off the ruined gauntlet and throws it to the side. Clark flies towards him, anger evident in his face.]

Batman: Clark, no... This world needs you!

[Wordlessly, Clark activates his heat vision again. Batman blocks it with the other gauntlet.]

Lois Lane: Clark! Clark!

[The military man and police officer briefly try to hold her back, but she runs out of their reach.]

Millitary Officer: Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire, hold your fire!

[Lois steps in front of Batman. Clark's heat vision deactivates.]

Lois Lane: Clark... Please.

[He descends, floating to ground level. She approaches him slowly, studying his face.]

Lois Lane: Please.

[She hugs him. Batman stands.]

Lois Lane: Please. Just go. Let's go.

[Clark leans into the hug, then takes off with Lois in his arms.]

The Flash: I'm so sorry.

Man: Take cover!

Cyborg: He's coming.

Wonder Woman: The Motherbox. Where is it?

Silas Stone: Come on. Come on...

PA Announcement: Attention, security breach detected. Sector Four, Level Three. Implement lockdown procedures immediately.

Steppenwolf: Give me the Motherbox!

Cyborg: No.

Cyborg: No, no, no, no, no!

Cyborg: DAD! WAIT! DON'T!

[Silas activates the machine, superheating the Third Motherbox and redirecting the energy around the room at the cost of his life.]

[He disintegrates. Cyborg could only watch before he is hit by Steppenwolf.]

Steppenwolf: So begins the end.

The Flash: Victor?

The Flash: Victor. Whoa, you okay, man? Come on.

The Flash: Victor?

Cyborg: He's dead.

The Flash: What?

Cyborg: My father. I didn't save him. I couldn't...

The Flash: Oh, my god.

Aquaman: His father's dead 'cause of us. I told you waking that box was a bad idea!

Wonder Woman: It wasn't a bad idea! We needed Superman. We still do.

Aquaman: Well, whatever returned? It isn't Superman. His body and powers, maybe. But it ain't him.

Batman: It is him. He recognized Lois Lane.

Aquaman: Who?

Wonder Woman: The woman he loves. He remembers her.

Aquaman: Nah. He went to her 'cause she wasn't afraid of him. It's called instinct, Diana.

The Flash: Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?

Wonder Woman: He's gone back to his base, to assemble the three boxes.

Aquaman: And we don't know where his base is, or how long until--

Batman: Hours. Boxes synchronize, Unity forms, we don't get there in time to stop it, the planet dies.

Cyborg: This is not your...

Cyborg: Oh, he knew. He knew, he knew, he knew, he knew! He wasn't trying to destroy the box, he- he was- he was trying to superheat it! Y'know, he made the core the hottest things on earth outside of a nuclear reactor! Anything that hot would have to--

Batman: --blink off the charts on a thermal imaging system. Your father sacrificed himself to mark that box. We have to get back to my lab and use the satellite to scan the earth for thermal anomalies.

Cyborg: I'm already on it.

The Flash: I'm sorry, you have a satellite?

Batman: I have six.

The Flash: Right.

Cyborg: Let's go find this son of a bitch.
Part 6: "Something Darker"

Lois Lane: You brought us here. You remembered.

Clark Kent: This is home.

Lois Lane: You spoke.

Clark Kent: Did I not, before?

Lois Lane: Your mother got behind on payments. She never told anyone.

Clark Kent: I don't understand.

Lois Lane: She's a proud woman, Clark. Here, um...

Clark Kent: She loved it here... So did I. So did I...

Barry Allen: Wow, this is awesome!

Bruce Wayne: I brought some friends.

Barry Allen: Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

Bruce Wayne: Everyone, this is Alfred, I work for him.

Diana Prince: Alfred.

Alfred Pennyworth: Good day, m'am.

Arthur Curry: It's badass, Alfred.

Alfred Pennyworth: Well. I'll put on the tea.

Bruce Wayne: Great.

Alfred Pennyworth: I dunno where we're gonna find the cups.

Bruce Wayne: There's the Motherbox. Right there.

Diana Prince: Go to visible spectrum?

Diana Prince: Pozharnov. Ghost city not far from Moscow. It's been abandoned since the nuclear accident there 30 years ago.

Victor Stone: Not even the army goes in.

Barry Allen: Right, it's probably so radioactive that you grow an extra foot out of your neck.

Victor Stone: Not any more. He's harvesting the radiation to build his base.

Diana Prince: Zoom.

Arthur Curry: What the hell is he building?

Victor Stone: The Unity's in there.

Bruce Wayne: We'll attack from above.

Diana Prince: Explosives won't separate the boxes, only strengthen their bond.

Barry Allen: What, so we can't blow it up?

Victor Stone: Not from the outside. I wanna plug into The Unity, one-on-one. Fuse with it. Weaken its bond from the inside so we can break it back into three.

Diana Prince: No, you don't know what you'd be up against. You'd have to stream into The Unity by yourself. These boxes together are world destroyers. A billion years old. They'll get inside you and find your weaknesses and your fears and use them to destroy you.

Victor Stone: Just get me in and give me time.

Diana Prince: You could die, Victor.

Victor Stone: If I don't, we all die. Period!

Victor Stone: I got nothing left. You wanted me to use these gifts, right? That's what I'm gonna do.

Barry Allen: Okay, so... If Victor wants to save the world by fusing with the doom boxes, I say we put him in the doom boxes. But getting him in means attacking that base.

Arthur Curry: We're fighting the devil and his armies in hell.

Barry Allen: I mean, this-- This guy's probably fought hundreds of thousands of other super-beings on the other planets he's destroyed, right? And we have to assume he's won.

Bruce Wayne: I don't care how many demons he's fought in how many hells. He's never fought us. Not us united.

Clark Kent: I'll take that as a "yes".

Lois Lane: What?

Clark Kent: The ring.

Lois Lane: You're really back?

Clark Kent: I have a second chance, Lo. I am not gonna waste it.

Martha Kent: You're really you?

Clark Kent: I'm really me, Ma.

Clark Kent: Listen, Ma. They wanted me back for a reason. I need to find out why.

Arthur Curry: How's Victor doing?

Barry Allen: Y'know... He wanted to be by himself.

Arthur Curry: We're asking a kid who just lost his father to go up against the most powerful machines in the universe. It's not fair.

Barry Allen: I thought you didn't care.

Arthur Curry: I never said that.

Diana Prince: What is it?

Bruce Wayne: Oh, I... I had a dream. Like a-- I don't know, almost like a premonition. It was the end of the world. Barry Allen was right here, and he said to me, "Lois Lane is the key".

Diana Prince: She is. To Superman. Every heart has one.

Bruce Wayne: I think it's something more. Something darker.

Alfred Pennyworth: Master Wayne. Master Wayne! You need to see this.

Bruce Wayne: You fixed it!

Victor Stone: It wanted to fly. Flight is its nature.

Bruce Wayne: Yours, too.

Bruce Wayne: He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

Alfred Pennyworth: What makes you so sure?

Bruce Wayne: Faith, Alfred! Faith.

Steppenwolf: At last. Prepare for His arrival! My redemption is nigh.

Steppenwolf: Unite...

Steppenwolf: Synchronize!

Victor Stone: The satellites revealed he's created a defensive dome.

Bruce Wayne: It's a design flaw. Take out the tower, the dome will fall. The enemy never anticipated a frontal assault.

Barry Allen: Right, probably because he didn't think anyone would be that nuts.

Victor Stone: Bruce is right. We've got to destroy the defensive dome so we can reach The Unity before it synchronizes.

Arthur Curry: What if the dome's not destroyed?

Bruce Wayne: It'll be destroyed.

Diana Prince: Once Victor is linked with The Unity, with Barry's help, he'll break through The Unity's defenses.

Arthur Curry: Remind me, how's that, again?

Barry Allen: Uh, with the power of love?

Victor Stone: Barry.

Barry Allen: With a catastrophic energy surge.

Victor Stone: Good.

Bruce Wayne: You'll have to run faster than you've ever attempted to generate a charge of that size. Then you make physical contact with Victor. That force should propel him inside The Unity. And, Victor, it's all up to you. Take it apart from the inside before it synchronizes.

Barry Allen: We finally, actually have a plan.

Bruce Wayne: We have a plan.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] The symbol of the House of El means hope. Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] Clark.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] That's what you can bring them.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] You were sent here for a reason.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] And even if it take you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] They will stumble, they will fall.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] You're gonna have to make a choice.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] They will join you in the sun, Kal.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] You will help them accomplish wonders.

Jor-El: [Voice Over] All the hopes and dreams of Krypton live in you now.

Jonathan Kent: [Voice Over] We're so proud of you,son.
